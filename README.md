# DataViz-gender-inequality
This is a bund of data visualization on the gender inequality in the labor market.

This is originally the collection of assignments for one of my coursework. The general idea of this collection of data visualization is to briefly explore some perspectives of the labor market, and mainly focus on the gender inequality. It includes different topics, and for each topic, there is an individual purpose statement and what might I expect to see from the plot.
